At least 4 texture examples. 

We have more than 4 but we made 2 of those by ourselves which are, the road, and the grass textures, then other examples are the sidewalk, the roundabout floor and the roundabout fountain, all of those contain textures with a normal map. 

At least 4 materials examples.

We also have more than 4, but some examples are, the Parking spots are a material done by us, also all the arrows and cross walk have a custom material which is translucent so it looks more real. Then the yellow of the sidewalk is also a simple material which is only yellow and also a bit transparent. And finally other material could be the ones in every building, the garages for example.

 At least 4 3D-models examples.

We have our cars which are 4 3d models, but we also imported, houses, buildings, trees, a fountain and the semaphores. 

At least 1 semaphore example. 

We imported the asset package of semaphores and did 2 of them by ourselves with the prefabs we imported, both of the semaphores are for each side of the road. 

At least 1 road example (asphalt) with signaling (pass and continuous lines).

We made the roads with different objects, first we made a plane with the asphalt material with textures, the made the arrows and crosswalk with a probuilder tool, then the dividing lane was also done with a probuilder plane. 

 At least 1 example of pedestrian crossing, with proper signs. 

The pedestrian crossing is in every semaphore and we added a walk sign in the bottom semaphore that goes down.

At least 1 example of sideways. 

The side road is on every road that goes to the roundabout. It is divided by a plane made with probuilder. 

At least 1 example of buildings.

All buildings were imported from unity asset store. And there are buildings in every part of the city.


 At least 2 point light sources.

We have more than two but the most relevant are the one on the roundabout and the one in the ferris wheel as they show how the point light works. 

The model of the crossing (roundabout) for cars. This must be as close as possible to the final solution. 

The roundabout is in the middle of the city, it was made with a floor with an asphalt material and with an imported fountain.
